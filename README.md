## Hi, I'm Danielle!

For 15 years I was a Surveyor on infrastructure projects in and around New York City, including:
- the World Trade Center
- the Second Avenue Subway Line
- the Mario M. Cuomo (Tappan Zee) Bridge, and 
- LaGuardia Airport

As a Surveyor I had the priveledge of working with every trade on nearly every phase of a project. It is incredibly fulfilling to drive on a finished elevated roadway that you had layed the piles out for years before. To me, Surveying is one of the most eye opening, unique, and utterly cool jobs a person could ever have.

So what am I doing here? Great Question!  
I reached a certain age ðŸ˜‰ during Covid and did what millions of others did, I started reevaluating my life. By fall of 2022 I was enrolled in an online Masters program at Pace University and can say, with a bit of shock, that I will have a masters in Data Science this May. 

Over the coming weeks I will add projects I have learned from over the past year and a half. And if I'm really feeling fancy, I'll include my entire resume on here.
