## Hi, I'm Danielle!

For 15 years I was a Surveyor on infrastructure projects in and around New York City, including:
- the World Trade Center
- the Second Avenue Subway Line
- the Mario M. Cuomo (Tappan Zee) Bridge, and 
- LaGuardia Airport

As a Surveyor I had the priveledge of working with every trade on nearly every phase of a project. It is incredibly fulfilling to drive on a finished elevated roadway that you had layed the piles out for years before. To me, Surveying is one of the most eye opening, unique, and utterly cool jobs a person could ever have.

So what am I doing here? Great Question!

After years of contemplating a career change to Data Science, or something related, a combination of the pandemic and age motivated me to do something more than wonder. By fall of 2022 I was enrolled in an online program at Pace University and May of this year I completed an MS in Data Science.
